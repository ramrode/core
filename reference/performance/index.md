# Performance

This reference document contains performance test results of Ella Core, covering data plane throughput and latency as well as PDU session support.

## Results

### Throughput (iPerf3)

The following table outlines the performance test results of Ella Core's data plane throughput:

| Uplink (Gbps) | Downlink (Gbps) |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 10+           | 10+             |

The tests could saturate the 10Gbps connection consistently, with or without NAT enabled, with CPU usage peaking at 8%.

### Throughput (TRex)

The following table outlines the performance test results of Ella Core's data plane throughput:

| Packet size (bytes) | Uplink    | Downlink  |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| 46                  | 2.50 Mpps | 5.20 Mpps |
| 494                 | 2.17 Mpps | 2.17 Mpps |
| 1456                | 812 Kpps  | 812 Kpps  |

The packet size represents only the IP packet for the subscribers and ignores Ethernet and GTP encapsulation.

Downlink performance is better as the number of packets increases as the flows are able to handled by different cores using [Receive Side Scaling (RSS)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/scaling.html). The uplink flows are all seen by the NIC drivers as the same flow, because of the GTP encapsulation.

When enabling NAT, we got the following results:

| Packet size (bytes) | Uplink    |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| 46                  | 1.72 Mpps |
| 494                 | 1.70 Mpps |
| 1456                | 812 Kpps  |

Downlink with NAT was not supported by our testing script.

### Latency (Round-trip)

The following table outlines the performance test results of Ella Core's data plane latency:

| Average (ms) | Best (ms) | Worst (ms) | Mean Deviation (ms) |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| 1.160        | 0.803     | 1.457      | 0.194               |

The value represents the round-trip-response times from the subscriber's device to the server and back.

### PDU Session Support

Ella Core can support up to **1000 subscribers** using a PDU session simultaneously. This was tested with **ueransim**, using 10 simulated gNodeBs each handling 100 subscribers.

## Methodology

We performed performance tests with Ella Core running on a baremetal system with the following specifications:

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **CPU**: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1540p
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Disk**: 512GB NVMe SSD
- **NICs**: 2 x Intel Corporation 82599ES 10-Gigabit

The RAN simulator used was [Packet Rusher](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/PacketRusher)

Performance Testing Environment
