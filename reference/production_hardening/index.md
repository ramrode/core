# Production Hardening

This reference document provides guidelines for operating Ella Core in a production environment.

## Recommendations

- **Deploy on a production-grade system**. Ensure your system meets the [production requirements](https://docs.ellanetworks.com/reference/system_reqs/index.md).
- **Deploy with the snap**: Use the [Snap installation method](https://docs.ellanetworks.com/how_to/install/#__tabbed_1_1) to deploy Ella Core.
- **Isolate network interfaces**: Use separate network interfaces for N2, N3, N6, and API traffic.
- **Use TLS**: Configure TLS for the API interface in the configuration file. Use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Use the fastest attach mode the interfaces allow**: set `datapath.attach-mode` to `xdp-native` where the driver supports it. On veth interfaces it needs an XDP program on the peer, and `tcx` is the practical choice — see [Datapath constraints](https://docs.ellanetworks.com/reference/connectivity/#datapath-constraints).
- **Set logging level to info**: Configure system logging level to `info` and use file output.
- **Disable telemetry**: Disable telemetry in the configuration file.
- **Rotate logs**: Implement log rotation for system and audit logs.
- **Back up the database**: Back up the database file on a **daily** basis. Retain backups for at least **7 days**. Backup archives contain sensitive secrets; store and transfer them encrypted and treat them as admin credentials.
- **Monitor metrics**: Operate an external Observability stack to collect and visualize metrics exposed by Ella Core.
