# Configuration File

Ella is configured using a yaml formatted file.

Start Ella core with the `--config` flag to specify the path to the configuration file.

## Parameters

- `logging` (object): The logging configuration.
    - `system` (object): The system logging configuration.
        - `level` (string): The log level. Options are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.
        - `output` (string): The output for the logs. Options are `stdout` and `file`.
        - `path` (string): The path to the log file. This is only used if the output is set to `file`.
    - `audit` (object): The audit logging configuration.
        - `output` (string): The output for the logs. Options are `stdout` and `file`.
        - `path` (string): The path to the log file. This is only used if the output is set to `file`.
- `db` (object): The database configuration.
    - `path` (string): The path to the directory holding the database file (`ella.db`).
- `interfaces` (object): The network interfaces configuration.
    - `n2` (object): The configuration for the n2 interface. This interface should be connected to the radios.
        - `name` (string): The name of the network interface to listen on (optional: either name or address must be provided). When set, the server binds to all IP addresses configured on this interface. Link-local addresses (IPv6 link-local and IPv4 link-local) are automatically excluded.
        - `address` (string): The IP address to listen on. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (optional: either name or address must be provided). When set, the server binds to this specific address.
        - `port` (int): The port to listen on.
    - `n3` (object): The configuration for the n3 interface. This interface should be connected to the radios.
        - `name` (string): The name of the network interface (optional: either name or address must be provided).
        - `address` (string): The address to listen on. Currently only IPv4 is supported (optional: either name or address must be provided).
    - `n6` (object): The configuration for the n6 interface. This interface should be connected to the internet.
        - `name` (string): The name of the network interface.
    - `api` (object): The configuration for the api interface.
        - `name` (string): The name of the network interface to listen on (optional: either name or address must be provided). When set, the server listens on all addresses (`0.0.0.0`) but uses `SO_BINDTODEVICE` to restrict incoming traffic to this interface. Use this when you want to bind to a device without pinning to a specific IP address.
        - `address` (string): The IP address to listen on. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (optional: either name or address must be provided). When set, the server binds to this specific address.
        - `port` (int): The port to listen on.
        - `tls` (object): The TLS configuration (optional).
            - `cert` (string): The path to the TLS certificate file (optional).
            - `key` (string): The path to the TLS key file (optional).
- `xdp` (object): The XDP configuration.
    - `attach-mode` (string): The XDP attach mode. Options are `native` and `generic`. `native` is the most performant option and only works on supported drivers.
- `telemetry` (object): The telemetry configuration.
    - `enabled` (boolean): Whether telemetry is enabled or not. Default is `false`.
    - `otlp-endpoint` (string): The endpoint for the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) collector.
- `cluster` (object): Clustering configuration for high-availability deployments. See [Clustering](#clustering) for the walkthrough.
    - `enabled` (boolean): Enables HA mode. When `false`, Ella Core runs as a standalone single-server instance.
    - `node-id` (int, 1–63): Unique per node. Baked into this node's leaf certificate and 5G-GUTIs.
    - `bind-address` (string): `host:port` the cluster listener binds to. Carries Raft consensus and cluster HTTP over mTLS.
    - `advertise-address` (string, optional): `host:port` peers use to reach this node. Host may be an IP or DNS name. Defaults to `bind-address`. Must appear in `peers` and must not use an unspecified IP.
    - `peers` (list of strings): `host:port` of every node in the cluster. Host may be an IP or DNS name. Must include this node's own `advertise-address` (or `bind-address` if `advertise-address` is unset) as the same string.
    - `join-token` (string, optional): Single-use token minted on an existing voter via `POST /api/v1/cluster/pki/join-tokens`. Required on the first boot of a node joining an existing cluster; consumed and ignored on subsequent starts. Its presence also tells the daemon that this node is a joiner, not the founder.
    - `initial-suffrage` (string, optional): `voter` or `nonvoter`. Defaults to `voter`.
    - `join-timeout` (duration string, optional): Maximum wait for cluster formation during discovery.
    - `propose-timeout` (duration string, optional): Maximum wait for a Raft commit before the API returns 503.
    - `snapshot-interval` (duration string, optional): Minimum interval between automatic Raft snapshots.
    - `snapshot-threshold` (int, optional): Minimum number of applied log entries between automatic snapshots.

!!! note
    When you use the Ella Core snap, the configuration file is located at `/var/snap/ella-core/common/config.yaml`. After modifying the configuration file, restart Ella Core with `sudo snap restart ella-core.cored` for the changes to take effect.

## Example

```yaml
logging:
  system:
    level: "info"
    output: "stdout"
  audit:
    output: "file"
    path: "/var/log/ella_system.log"
db:
  path: "/var/lib/ella-core"
interfaces:
  n2:
    address: "22.22.22.2"
    port: 38412
  n3:
    name: "ens5"
  n6:
    name: "ens3"
  api:
    address: "0.0.0.0"
    port: 5002
    tls:
      cert: "/etc/ella/cert.pem"
      key: "/etc/ella/key.pem"
xdp:
  attach-mode: "native"
telemetry:
  enabled: true
  otlp-endpoint: "localhost:4317"
```

## Clustering

Enable clustering on each node to deploy Ella Core in a high-availability configuration. See [Deploy a High Availability Cluster](../how_to/deploy_ha_cluster.md) for the walkthrough.

```yaml
cluster:
  enabled: true
  node-id: 1
  bind-address: "10.0.0.1:7000"
  peers:
    - "10.0.0.1:7000"
    - "10.0.0.2:7000"
    - "10.0.0.3:7000"
```

!!! note
    Write requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) are automatically forwarded to the current Raft leader; reads are served by any node.

## IPv6 Support

Ella Core supports IPv6 addresses for the management interface (`api`), the radio interface (`n2`) and the GTPU interface (`n3`).

The following example demonstrates using an IPv6 address for those interfaces:

```yaml
interfaces:
  n2:
    address: "2001:db8::1"
    port: 38412
  n3:
    address: "2001:dba::1"
  n6:
    name: "ens3"
  api:
    address: "2001:db9::1"
    port: 5002
```

The following example demonstrates using all non link-local addresses for those interfaces:

```yaml
interfaces:
  n2:
    name: "ens5"
    port: 38412
  n3:
    address: "ens4"
  n6:
    name: "ens3"
  api:
    name: "ens0"
    port: 5002
```

!!! note
    IPv6 support is currently available for the management interface (`api`), radio interface (`n2`) and GTPU interface (`n3`). Only IPv4 is currently supported for the UE traffic and the data network interface (`n6`).

## GTP-U Transport over IPv6

Ella Core supports GTP-U tunnels over IPv6 for the N3 interface (between the core and the gNB). When a gNB advertises a dual-stack transport address (both IPv4 and IPv6) in the N2 signaling and Ella Core is configured for dual-stack, Ella Core always prefers IPv6 for the GTP-U data path.

To ensure Ella Core always uses IPv4 or IPv6 for GTP-U, specify an address of that family in the configuration file, or ensure only IPs of that family are configured on the interface.
